This is an attempt to solve exercises of DL course (Tehran University-Kalhor-fall2023) .

The goal is to learn coding of DL. Therefor, all the questions and requests of the exercises might not be solved, but enough answers are given that a good understading of the requested topic is done.

I try to learn Pytorch and TensorFlow, so a question might be answered with both of these libraries. And sometimes, one of these libraries might be used.
I will write as much as explaining that I think is required in the jpyter notebooks for a better understanding.

I also write a report in English as I was really attending the course and I needed to submit my answer.
